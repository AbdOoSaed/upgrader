A simple prompt widget is displayed when a newer app version is availabe
in the store. With today's modern app stores, there is little need to persuade users to upgrade
because most of them are already using the auto upgrade feature. However, there may be times when
an app needs to be updated more quickly than usual, and nagging a user to upgrade will entice
the upgrade sooner. Also, with Flutter supporting more than just Android and iOS app stores in the
future, it will become more likely that users on other app stores need to be nagged about
upgrading. 

## Example

Just wrap your body widget in the UpgradeAlert widget, and it will handle the rest.
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:upgrader/upgrader.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  MyApp({
    Key key,
  }) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Upgrader Example',
      home: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            title: Text('Upgrader Example'),
          ),
          body: UpgradeAlert(
            child: Center(child: Text('Checking...')),
          )
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Customization

The UpgradeAlert widget can be customized by setting parameters in the constructor of the
UpgradeAlert widget.

* buttonTitleIgnore: the ignore button title, which defaults to ```Ignore```
* buttonTitleLater: the later button title, which defaults to ```Later```
* buttonTitleUpdate: the update button title, which defaults to ```Update Now```
* daysUntilAlertAgain: days until alerting user again, which defaults to ```3```
* debugEnabled: Enable print statements for debugging, which defaults to ```false```

* onIgnore: Called when the ignore button is tapped, defaults to ```null```
* onLater: Called when the ignore button is tapped, defaults to ```null```
* onUpdate: Called when the ignore button is tapped, defaults to ```null```
  
* prompt: the call to action message, which defaults to ```Would you like to update it now?```
* title: the alert dialog title, which defaults to ```Update App?```

## Limitations
This widget works on both Android and iOS. When running on iOS the App Store will provide the
latest app version and will display the prompt at the appropriate times.

On Android, this widget does nothing as there is no easy way to query the
Google Play Store for metadata about an app. Without the metadata, the widget cannot compare the
app version with the latest Play Store version. It will not disrupt the widget tree and can be
included in an Android without any issues. Support for Android coming soon.

## iTunes Search API

There is a class in this Flutter package used by the UpgradeAlert widget to download app details 
from the
[iTunes Search API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api).
The class ITunesSearchAPI can be used standalone with the
UpgradeAlert widget to query iTunes for app details.
```dart
final iTunes = ITunesSearchAPI();
final resultsFuture = iTunes.lookupByBundleId('com.google.Maps');
resultsFuture.then((results) {
    print('results: $results');
});
```

## Appcast

The class [Appcast](lib/src/appcast.dart), in this Flutter package, is used by the Upgrader widgets
to download app details from an appcast,
based on the [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org/) framework by Andy Matuschak.
You can read the Sparkle documentation here:
https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/publishing/.

An appcast is an RSS feed with one channel that has a collection of items that each describe
one app version. The appcast will decscribe each app version and will provide the latest app
version to Upgrader that indicates when an upgrade should be recommended.

The appcast must be hosted on a server that can be reached by everyone from the app. The appcast
XML file can be autogenerated during the release process, or just manually updated after a release
is available on the app store.

The Appcast class can be used stand alone or as part of Upgrader.


### Example - Stand alone
```dart
final appcast = Appcast();
final items = await appcast.parseAppcastItemsFromUri('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/larryaasen/upgrader/master/test/testappcast.xml');
final bestItem = appcast.bestItem();
```

### Appcast Sample File
